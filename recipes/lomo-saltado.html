        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lomo saltado is a beloved Peruvian stir-fry that masterfully blends Chinese cooking techniques with traditional Peruvian ingredients, reflecting the country's rich culinary fusion. The dish features tender strips of beef sautéed with onions, tomatoes, and ají amarillo (Peruvian yellow pepper), creating a colorful and flavorful medley. Soy sauce and vinegar add depth to the stir-fry, while cilantro provides a fresh, aromatic finish. Lomo saltado is typically served with both crispy French fries and steamed white rice, combining the best of two worlds in one satisfying meal.</p>
        <p>What makes lomo saltado truly unique is its mix of textures and flavors: the juicy, marinated beef paired with the slight crunch of the vegetables, all coated in a savory sauce that’s both tangy and slightly spicy. The French fries, traditionally mixed into the stir-fry or served alongside, soak up the rich juices, adding to the dish’s heartiness. Lomo saltado is a vibrant and comforting dish that perfectly encapsulates the fusion of Peruvian and Chinese cuisine, making it a staple in Peruvian households and restaurants alike.</p>
