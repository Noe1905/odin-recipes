        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>Ají de gallina</em> is a classic Peruvian dish that combines shredded chicken with a rich, creamy sauce made from a blend of yellow ají peppers, bread, and milk. The sauce is smooth and slightly spicy, with a hint of nuttiness from the addition of ground walnuts or pecans, giving it a complex and comforting flavor. Traditionally served over white rice with boiled potatoes and black olives, this dish is a perfect example of Peru’s unique fusion of indigenous ingredients and European influences.</p>
        <p>The vibrant yellow sauce gets its color and mild heat from <em>ají amarillo</em>, a key ingredient in Peruvian cuisine. Ají de gallina is often topped with slices of hard-boiled eggs, adding texture and a finishing touch to the dish. It’s a hearty, satisfying meal that balances creamy, savory, and spicy elements, making it a favorite in homes and restaurants across Peru.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>In a large pot, place the chicken breasts and cover with chicken broth (or water). Add a bay leaf and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the pot, reserving the broth, and let it cool. Once cool, shred the chicken into thin strips and set aside.</li>
        <li>Soak the bread slices in 1 cup of the reserved chicken broth for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a blender, blend the soaked bread and evaporated milk until you get a smooth mixture. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and ají amarillo (chopped or paste), and cook for another 3 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ground walnuts (or pecans), cumin, and turmeric (if using). Cook for an additional minute.</li>
        <li>Pour the bread and milk mixture into the pan with the onions and ají, stirring constantly until the sauce begins to thicken, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded chicken and Parmesan cheese, mixing everything together until the chicken is coated in the creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>If the sauce is too thick, add a bit more reserved chicken broth to reach your desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve the Ají de Gallina over a bed of white rice and alongside boiled potato slices.</li>
        <li>Garnish with slices of hard-boiled eggs, black olives, and fresh parsley or cilantro (optional).</li>
