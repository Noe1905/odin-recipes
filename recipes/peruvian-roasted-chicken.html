        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Peruvian roasted chicken, also known as <em>pollo a la brasa</em>, is a flavorful dish that highlights the rich culinary traditions of Peru. The chicken is marinated in a blend of spices including garlic, cumin, paprika, and Peruvian aji peppers, giving it a distinctive smoky and spicy flavor. The marinade also typically includes lime juice and soy sauce, which provide a bright acidity and umami depth. Once the chicken is roasted to perfection, the skin becomes crispy and golden, while the meat inside remains juicy and tender, infused with all the bold seasonings.</p>
        <p>Served alongside a variety of vibrant sides like crisp French fries, tangy coleslaw, or a fresh salad, Peruvian roasted chicken offers a satisfying and balanced meal. It’s often accompanied by <em>ají verde</em> (a spicy green sauce) or <em>huancaína</em> sauce for dipping, both of which add extra layers of heat and creaminess. This dish has grown in popularity worldwide, loved for its unique flavor profile that combines traditional Latin American ingredients with influences from Asian and European cuisine. Perfect for gatherings or a hearty family meal, Peruvian roasted chicken is a must-try recipe.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the marinade</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken (about 3-4 pounds)</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lime juice (freshly squeezed)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vinegar (white or apple cider)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground aji amarillo (or substitute with cayenne pepper)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric (optional, for extra color)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For serving</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh cilantro (optional, for garnish)</li>
            <li>French fries, coleslaw, or salad</li>
            <li><em>Ají verde</em> (Peruvian green sauce) or <em>huancaína</em> sauce for dipping</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the minced garlic, soy sauce, lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, cumin, paprika, black pepper, oregano, smoked paprika, aji amarillo (or cayenne), salt, and turmeric (if using). Mix well until it forms a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Rinse and pat dry the whole chicken.</li>
        <li>Carefully rub the marinade all over the chicken, ensuring to coat the inside cavity and underneath the skin for maximum flavor.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in a large resealable plastic bag or a covered bowl. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to fully infuse.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Remove the marinated chicken from the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken on a roasting rack or a baking sheet, breast-side up.</li>
        <li>Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes (20 minutes per pound), or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) in the thickest part of the thigh. Baste the chicken with its juices halfway through cooking.</li>
        <li>For extra crispy skin, turn the oven to broil for the last 5 minutes of cooking. Watch closely to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute and keeps the meat tender.</li>
        <li>Serve the roasted chicken with your choice of sides such as French fries, salad, or coleslaw. Don’t forget to include ají verde or huancaína sauce for dipping!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Enjoy your flavorful Peruvian roasted chicken!</h3>
