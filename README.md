Odin Recipes Project

This is my first project from The Odin Project. As part of the TOP curriculum, I built a basic recipe website using HTML. This project showcases my ability to:

- Structure web pages using foundational HTML elements.
- Create pages with multiple links for navigation.
- Incorporate headings, lists, and images to enhance content organization.
